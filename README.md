## Project 5 - Tumblr Feed Alert!!

Submitted by: Christopher Petit

Tumblr Feed is a social media app that tracks what a ton of people 
are feeling. If you care they'll share. Within this app you have
the ability to scroll up and down X amount of feeds with the option
to refresh the feed by dragging down new the beginning of the feeds.
This is the Unit 5 project within the Codepath IOS Dev course.


Time spent: 7 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X ] App has a configured table view and table view call
- [X ] App populates the table view with data fetched from an API


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] App fetches posts from a different Tumblr blog
- [X ] App has a refresh control to update the table view

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
I feel that while I have a refresh feature it is not as prominent because I
can not access other feeds. Maybe I should have taken the time to complete the
different Tumblr blog portion.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The major challenge that was faced while completing the project 
was the presence of a white screen while running the code many times, I was able to fix it
after I notcied I incorrectly added an extra connector to my
sumarry defintion in the storyboard.
